## Technical Aspects
This URL shortner tool is specially designed for converting long URs to fit it into respective short URLs.

* This is a simple flask app which takes an URL and shortens it. This shortened verion of the URL redirects to the user to the long URL. 
*For each long URL given by the user the application randomly generates an alphabetical combination which redirects to the long URL.


## List of Features :-
    1. Convert long URLs into short URLs.
    2. List all previous shorted URLs (Show History).
    3. For same long URL it will always return same short URL.
    4. Redirect to actual web url: Once you click either Long URL or Short URL shown
       in tables, you will be redirected to actual web page.
